# Elliptical Reflector Antenna for Tumor Treatment

## Overview
This project explores the design and simulation of an elliptical reflector antenna for tumor treatment using Altair FEKO. The goal is to analyze how specific ISM band frequencies interact with biological tissues to enhance microwave ablation and disrupt tumor cell division using circularly polarized microwaves.

## Objectives
- Design and optimize a broadband microstrip patch antenna.
- Integrate the antenna with an elliptical reflector to achieve precise energy focusing.
- Analyze Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR).
- Evaluate radiation focusing at the second focal point of the elliptical reflector.

## Approach
- **Frequency Selection:** Choosing an appropriate ISM band frequency for effective tissue penetration.
- **Antenna Design:** Developing a broadband microstrip patch antenna optimized for the selected frequency.
- **Elliptical Reflector Integration:** Ensuring that microwaves originate from one focal point and converge at the second focal point for precise energy delivery.
- **Simulation & Analysis:**
  - **Microwave Ablation:** Using focused microwaves to heat and destroy tumor cells.
  - **Polarization-Based Disruption:** Implementing circularly polarized microwaves to interfere with tumor cell division.
  - **Evaluating SAR & VSWR:** Assessing energy absorption efficiency and antenna impedance matching.
- **Presentation:** Compiling a PowerPoint presentation and a video demonstration for the final submission.

## Tools & Software
- **Altair FEKO:** Used for antenna modeling and electromagnetic simulation.
- **MATLAB/Python (optional):** For data analysis and post-processing.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/antenna_project.git
   cd antenna_project
   ```
2. Open the simulation files in Altair FEKO.
3. Run the simulations to analyze radiation patterns and energy focusing.
4. Modify parameters (e.g., frequency, reflector size) to optimize performance.

## Future Work
